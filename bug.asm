mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4]

This instruction attempts to access memory at the address calculated by ebx + ecx*4.  However, if ecx is large enough, this could cause an integer overflow, leading to accessing an unintended memory location.  This is particularly problematic if ecx is controlled by user input or is derived from untrusted data.  The overflow could corrupt memory or cause a program crash.
